## Installation

To get started, download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ebitheodore/gatehouse-ts/releases) section. Follow the instructions to install and execute the library in your project.

```bash
npm install gatehouse-ts
```

## Usage

Using Gatehouse TS is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate its capabilities.

```typescript
import { Gatehouse } from 'gatehouse-ts';

// Define your rules
const rules = {
  admin: ['view_users', 'edit_users'],
  user: ['view_users']
};

// Create a new instance of Gatehouse
const gatehouse = new Gatehouse(rules);

// Check permissions
const canEdit = gatehouse.can('admin', 'edit_users'); // true
const canView = gatehouse.can('user', 'edit_users'); // false
```

## Examples

### Basic Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use Gatehouse TS to manage permissions.

```typescript
const rules = {
  guest: [],
  user: ['view_content'],
  admin: ['view_content', 'edit_content']
};

const gatehouse = new Gatehouse(rules);

console.log(gatehouse.can('user', 'view_content')); // true
console.log(gatehouse.can('guest', 'edit_content')); // false
```

### Advanced Example

You can also define more complex rules using conditions.

```typescript
const rules = {
  user: {
    view_content: (user) => user.isLoggedIn,
    edit_content: (user) => user.isAdmin
  }
};

const gatehouse = new Gatehouse(rules);

const user = { isLoggedIn: true, isAdmin: false };

console.log(gatehouse.can(user, 'view_content')); // true
console.log(gatehouse.can(user, 'edit_content')); // false
```
